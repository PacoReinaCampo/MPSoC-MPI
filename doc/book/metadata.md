abstract: Message Passing Interface for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A Message Passing Interface (MPI) uses an object model to distinguish the general function from the specific implementations. The invoking program sends a message and relies on the object to select and execute the appropriate code. Using an intermediate layer essentially falls into two categories, encapsulation and distribution. Objects should be able to invoke services on other objects without knowing or caring about how those services are implemented.
